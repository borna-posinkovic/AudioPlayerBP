# AudioPlayerBP
basic audio player (wav, mp3 files)


DISCLAIMER: Example project using JUCE framework, I'm doing this for educational purposes, it isn't meant to be very good, just
to help me improve my C++ knowledge and learn the JUCE framework better, in hopes I will make better apps one day.

Current features:
1. Open,play,stop buttons
2. Waveform viewer with a moving position line
3. Plays wav files


To do:
1. Add a pause button, maybe change the interface
2. Add an equalizer


Currently the apps looks like this:

This would be the end goal (something like this) with added equalization:
